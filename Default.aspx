            The extension of the restrictions ...
            <br />  <br />
            We had otherwise hoped to be able to open up a little more for our activities here first in the new year… ..but with the extension of the restrictions it also means that we in Bjerringbro Idrætsforening must extend the closure of all indoor activities.
            We hope that the infection in society will be brought under control so that we have the opportunity to reopen as soon as possible.
            Of course, all memberships are automatically extended with the weeks we are forced to close.
            <br /><br />
          Yours sincerely
          The board of Sport Association Bjerringsbro
